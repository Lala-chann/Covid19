# Covid-19
📂 This beginner-friendly project explores performance using Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The analysis focuses on patterns in total vaccinations across four different countries during the period January 1 to January 5, 2022. The goal is to identify which country achieved the highest total vaccination count during this timeframe.

💉 Vaccination Data Insight:

- Opened the CSV file to inspect the dataset.
- Selected relevant columns necessary for analysis and visualization.
- Filtered data for four countries from the dataset and created separate subsets for each.
- Used total vaccination data to calculate and compare results across the selected countries.
- Transformed the data into a new DataFrame suitable for visualization.
- Created a histogram to display the distribution of total vaccinations.
- Generated a pie chart to visualize the proportion of vaccinations among the selected countries.
